I see you want to play *Sweetwater* from *Westworld* immediately on your electronic piano, even though you're starting from zero. No problem! Here’s the fastest way to do it.

### Step 1: Get Familiar with the Basics  
- **Only focus on white keys for now.**  
- Each white key is a note: **C D E F G A B** (repeats in cycles).  
- Find **Middle C**: It’s the white key just left of a group of two black keys, near the center.

### Step 2: Learn the Core Melody (Right Hand)  
Here’s the simplified main motif from *Sweetwater*, which repeats in the song:  

🎵 **E - G - A - G - E - C - D - E**  

- **E** (white key)
- **G** (skip one white key after E)
- **A** (right next to G)
- **G** (back to G)
- **E** (back to E)
- **C** (left of E)
- **D** (next to C)
- **E** (next to D)

### Step 3: Play with Rhythm  
- Try to play the notes **slowly and evenly** at first.  
- *Sweetwater* has a **bouncy, Western-style** feel, so once you're comfortable, give the notes a **short, snappy touch** rather than holding them down.

### Step 4: Left-Hand Support (Optional)  
- If you want to add a bit of bass, press **C** and **G** together with your left hand while playing the melody.

### Step 5: Repeat & Have Fun!  
- Don’t worry about mistakes!  
- Try playing it a few times and see how close you can get to the vibe of the song.  
- If you get stuck, **hum along while playing**, and your fingers will follow naturally.

Let me know if you want a **slightly more advanced** version after you get this down! 🚀
